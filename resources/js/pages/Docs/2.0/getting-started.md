## Introduction {.doc-heading}

Thanks for your interest in Serenity, we think you'll be pleasantly surprised by how easy it can be to build Enterprise level applications for the web and desktop, with the Serenity framework.

We've taken great care to craft an application framework that combines the simplicity of working with Laravel, with a more strict domain driven approach that helps ease the developer decision tree, but still provides a fast, simple approach to rapidly build applications.

## Benefits {.doc-heading}

The benefits of Serenity are far-reaching and you can read more about them in Core Concepts and under the Usage page for individual features.

- Built on the VITAL Stack (Vue, Inertia, Tailwind, ADR, Laravel)
- Snowflake Primary Database IDs
- Built in Documentation Platform
- Built in Design System
- Consistant Namespacing
- Customizable Auto Routing
- Teams, API, Two Factor Authorization by default
- Generators Galore
- NativePHP for PHP Desktop Applications
- Docker and Kubernetes Ready
- Super Powered with Laravel Octane
- SaaS Ready with Stripe Integration

Before we get going, we need to acknowledge those deveopers and companies whose Open Source contributions have made Serenity possible, and without whom it simply wouldn't exist.
